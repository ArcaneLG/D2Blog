#### Speaker's Sight Warlock

This is without a doubt my number 1 pick simply because it's practically guaranteed to be useful in specific situations that I'll discuss, and its utility is sort of unique in the grand scheme of the game. This build is the only build in the whole game that provides consistent healing to the whole team without needing kills. Anyone who's done a master dungeon will know that dps phases can often be scary because the boss is trying to kill you the entire time. This is emphasized by bosses that require you to move, which prevents Well of Radiance from protecting you for the whole phase (think Locus of Communion, Caiatl, Hefnd) or bosses that have extremely powerful attacks (Persys). 

That's not to say healing is the only thing this build can do. Because of Ember of Benevolence, you have constant access to all your abilities, which means high uptime on Hellion and on-demand healing from Phoenix Dive, constant Radiant for the whole team from Ember of Torches, and orb generation from Speaker's Sight itself. I have an article that delves deeper into this build for those that are interested.

#### Prismatic Warlock

Another obvious pick. Probably the strongest all-around build in the game right now with Getaway Artist, but it does get a lot of help from Episode 1's artifact. Once Galvanic Armor and Radiant Orbs go away, the subclass won't be quite as powerful as before, but it's still good in practically every situation in the game. Devour to keep yourself alive, Bleak Watcher to lock down threats, Arc Soul for some added offense and easy access to Devour, and access to both damage and survival supers makes this a very safe pick when you don't know quite what you're getting into.

While this build is very safe, it's not always the best. I put Speaker's Sight above this because that build keeps the whole team alive, while Prismatic Warlock is pretty selfish with its healing. It also doesn't have the potent offensive capabilities of the next two builds on this list, making it less desirable if there are bulky targets you need to take down quickly (conduit minotaurs in Spire, totem keepers in WR).

#### Prismatic Titan

This is basically the deal as Sunbracers from last season: high skill, high reward. If played well, this build is the most durable and most destructive in the game by a long shot. It's held back by the need to be surrounded, but this is easier to achieve than it might sound. The sheer offense of this build is what makes it valuable. There's no build up process; as soon as you see 'Biotic Enhancements' on the side of your screen, it's over for whatever's in your way. And the damage output is high enough that basically anything short of a full boss will die in two slams (even champions in GMs can be killed in one if you've stacked the right buffs).

I honestly have trouble coming up with a definitive weakness for this build. I suppose the situation you'd be most afraid of is a 1v1 with a tough target, especially bosses, since you don't have Biotic Enhancements to improve your melee, but it's not like the other top tier builds fare much better. If this scenario does pop up in the dungeon, it's best to stay back and let Speaker's Sight keep you healthy. However, if you can, try to leave some guys alive so when the big guy comes along, you have Biotic Enhancements and you can smash him.

#### Prismatic Hunter

I'll start by saying that this build's niche is damage. Golden gun hits very hard and works on most bosses. If you need more damage, bring this, otherwise you're probably better off with one of the builds above. That's not to say prismatic hunter is bad at surviving or ad clear. A stacked Combination Blow punch combined with Liar's Handshake will kill anything short of really tough targets, but even they can be taken down fairly safely with a combination of Slice and Cross Counter's healing.

The biggest problem with it is that it needs constant access to enemies at melee range, which means it could run into problems when enemies aren't plentiful at all times in an encounter. It also needs time and enemies to build up its buff, and without that buff it'll struggle.

#### Bonus Stuff

Damage Checks: Even if we assume the difficulty of Salvation's Edge, I don't think damage will be outrageously hard to execute. We have free weaken from grenade launchers right now, so there's no need to worry about debuffs which is actually really significant in teams of three.

Best DPS Weapons: Practically every boss can be Edge Transited, so bring that by default. Any boss that can be sworded will be sworded (fundamental theorem of close range weapons) so bring Falling Guillotine if that's the case. Dragon's Breath might be really good for the Speaker's Sight user if the phase is long since it's so ammo efficient. If the boss has a super easy crit, maybe Whisper.

General Advice: I doubt there will be an overall wipe timer present like in raids. They said there will be tokens and enrage, but that doesn't mean there's a time limit on setup phases. If this is true, your group should stick together at all times for maximum safety. The dungeon must be doable solo, so there's no reason to split up and add unnecessary risk.
