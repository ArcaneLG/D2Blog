#### Playstyle

This build revolves around using the Consecration aspect on Titan constantly to clear large groups, big bosses, and everything in between. This is a very aggressive and high-commitment build that requires you to get within range for Consecration, but rewards you with multiple layers of protection and unrivaled damage. 

The gameplay loop of this build is to use your multiple melee charges as Consecrations whenever you see an opportunity. Once you run out, you can activate your transcendence to instantly refund your melee charges and continue to smash everything you see. Remember to throw your prismatic grenade when you have the chance, since dealing damage with your grenade while transcendent improves your melee regeneration. Also keep in mind that your melee charges don't get refunded when transcendence ends, so if your meter is low, consider saving your charges. You can also use your super when you're out of melee charges and don't have transcendence, since you'll receive three full charges once it ends. Always use transcendence before Bladefury; your super is strand and fills the darkness section of your meter, which is considerably harder to fill than the light section because Consecration deals solar damage and fills it very quickly.

One important thing to note about this build is that you can't flip flop on whether you want to fight up close or shoot stuff from far away. Each time you close the distance or run away, you're giving the enemies time to shoot you, which is very risky. The build is designed to keep you healthy once you start smashing stuff with your hammers, but until you're within range you are very vulnerable. The biggest weaknesses of this build, other than needing to get very close to enemies to work, is not being able to open an engagement. It's important to pick the right time to get close, or you'll be killed. The shackle grenade is the best tool in the game to help you with this: throw it at a dangerous enemy before you run in and you'll be much safer.

#### Why Knockout?

Knockout gives you a hefty chunk of health back upon a melee kill, which works perfectly with the wide range of Consecration. Clearing groups of weak enemies will allow you to regain all your health, but you can also take advantage of this when attacking a tougher enemy. Because Consecration is a wave, not just a punch, you can often position yourself to catch ads with the wave while still hitting the boss, allowing you to stay healthy in a tough situation. If you find yourself low on health when you're in the middle of a consecrate, remember that you can control your movement in midair to redirect the second half of the attack, so you can switch targets from the boss to an ad and heal in a pinch.

#### How to survive

This loadout only requires two things to deal out incredible damage: Synthoceps and Consecration. Many of the other choices in this build are focused on keeping yourself alive even in Grandmaster difficulty environments.

The most obvious ways to stay safe are with healing from Knockout and Recuperation, but this build has multiple layers of damage reduction to maximize the value of that healing. Facet of Protection grants you 15% damage reduction when surrounded, which will happen naturally if you're playing around the Biotic Enhancements perk from Synthoceps. You also gain Woven Mail, granting you 45% damage reduction, when you pick up an orb of power, making you even harder to kill. And finally, in Episode 1, you can equip the Galvanic Armor perk for an additional 30% damage reduction while Amplified, which Knockout conveniently grants on a melee kill.

Furthermore, using three copies of Heavy Handed lets you generate orbs constantly. There's only a one second cooldown between orbs, so you can spam your Consecration and continue to recover using the orbs you've made while also receiving Woven Mail so you can stay in the fight.

Finally, as mentioned earlier, you have your shackle grenade which lets you suspend large groups so you can smash them without fear or run away if you realize you've overextended.

#### Weapons

This build can use a large variety of weapons effectively. The core is built around abilities, and thus it doesn't rely on a specific weapon to function. In fact, weapons generally slow down the pace of this build in close quarters, so it's totally fine to bring long range weapons to improve your efficiency at times when you can't get close. 

My advice is to use a darkness damage heavy weapon, since you'll find yourself needing dark transcendence energy quite often and heavy weapons are the most interchangeable. Kinetic primaries like Blast Furnace and Outbreak Perfected are excellent in Nightfalls, where you aren't always able to get in melee range, and you can build up your transcendence meter for the areas where you can. Riskrunner is also a notable choice in activities with a lot of arc damage where its 50% arc damage reduction can enable some very aggressive plays that speed up your run considerably.
