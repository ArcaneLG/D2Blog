#### Playstyle

This build is perhaps the closest thing in the game to a support class. It is not only extremely good at assisting teammates, but also relies on supporting teammates to reach its full potential. While it's not as flashy as other offense-heavy subclasses, its excellent ability uptime and healing make it a valuable asset at all levels of play.

The most important part of this build is actually a fragment: Ember of Benevolence. Whenever you apply Restoration, Cure, or Radiant to a teammate, you gain a hefty 400% boost to all three of your abilities for 6 seconds. This allows you to have 100% uptime on your healing turret, assuming you're healing an ally consistently (which should be fairly easy), which is already a very powerful effect. This also enables you to activate your class ability more often and activate Hellion, which adds to your otherwise lacking offensive capabilities. Add in Ember of Torches, and you'll be able to supply your team with every solar buff possible, letting you take down bulky enemies like champions efficiently.

In order to take advantage of Ember of Benevolence, you'll need to pay close attention to where your teammates are, and anticipate where they'll be in the future. For example, many raid encounters force the team to navigate different sections of an arena at any given time. It's important to know where and when your fireteam will be so you can place your healing turrets in positions that can reach them. You don't have to be too precise, since the healing turrets have a pretty generous range. Just make sure to check the left side of your screen for the Ember of Benevolence buff to make sure it's active. You can also activate the fragment by using your melee when allies are nearby to make them Radiant, or using your Phoenix Dive to give them Cure, if your turret isn't able to reach them for whatever reason. Finally, remember that giving yourself buffs doesn't activate the fragment, so if you choose to use your healing on yourself, you won't be getting that recharge bonus.

#### Ability Options

One nice thing about this build is that you can customize it depending on your exact playstyle and situation. The Solar subclass has many nice fragments that can improve this build in different ways. 

My pick for general play is Ember of Singeing, which gives you additional class ability regeneration when you scorch enemies. This is very nice combined with Hellion, which provides constant scorch and improves your Hellion uptime even without Ember of Benevolence. Since the build has fairly little offensive power, maintaining Hellion is very helpful.

If the encounter has many enemies, there is also room to consider Ember of Empyrean. Normally, this build only provides temporary buffs: a burst of healing from the turret and some brief Restoration, or Radiant from Ember of Torches. However, if you use Empyrean, you now have the ability to extend your Restoration and Radiant and keep those buffs active on yourself, enabling you to use your abilities to aid teammates without compromising your own safety.

Finally, if you want to enhance your offense with a bit more burst damage, you can use Ember of Ashes. This fragment enables Hellion to ignite a target in only 3 hits instead of 4, which can help it kill medium sized targets more quickly. Personally, I prefer to have a higher uptime on Hellion, but with both Singeing and Benevolence active, you'll find yourself often refreshing Hellion before it goes away, so picking Ashes as your final fragment is totally justified.

#### Weapons

Despite this being a Solar build, you don't necessarily have to use any Solar weapons. If you use Ember of Empyrean, I highly recommend a Solar primary to keep your buffs active. Outside of that, use whatever works for you. Ember of Singeing and Ember of Singeing do have synergy with Incandescent, but it's not so powerful that it makes Incandescent necessary. Heal clip technically works with Ember of Benevolence, but it's not really worth the effort to intentionally play around it (although it doesn't hurt to have another way to activate that fragment).

Sunshot and Aberrant Action are both excellent options in the energy slot, with some added synergy depending on your choice of fragments. Cartesian Coordinate, and fusion rifles in general, are very nice for this build, since you won't have the help of a grenade or powerful melee to take down bulky targets like champions. Outside of these suggestions, you can use whatever weapons you prefer, and adjust your armor mods accordingly.
